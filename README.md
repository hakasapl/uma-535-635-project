## Motivation

## Design Goals
Develop a time sync protocol using timestamped sensor data from two embedded devices. The data will be received by a raspberry pi device, and the synchronization protocol will run on the raspberry pi device

## Deliverables
* Characterize network delay between raspberry pi and edge devices
* Estimate clock drift between participitaing devices

## System Blocks

## Requirements (HW/SW)

## Team Member Responsibilities

## Timeline
